A tiny DOS based 3D level editor (in the making).

If you simply want to place objects or billboards/sprites in a 3D scene, the freeware scene currently offers limited options. GoDot/Unreal/Blender/Unity (or perhaps you're familiar with the Sony Level Editor) are examples of such programs. Here's a DOS/FreeDOS option for placing 3D objects in a 3D scene. It already offers many features and will be significantly expanded in the future. In fact, you can use this tool to create your 3D scenes right now. The only drawback is that it currently only supports the Wavefront OBJ file format. To have more than 32 MB of usable memory, you should use CWSDPMI or a similar program (SBEMU 1.1 includes a good DPMI host).
